## CSS
Adds styles, fonts, sizing and many other styling options to html/
rules are added to elements of html. These rules are applied in cascading order/
3 ways to style: main why is having a link to a css file that has the styling rules
### Rules
#### selector
who the rule applys to in the html. like a paragraph tag "<p>", this would be an element/
##### ID
one thing that has a specific id
##### Class
a group of things in a class
##### list
multiple elements like body,section
##### descendents
sections that are in bodys is the example. this would be written as->   body section
#### declaration
the colon
#### Property
what aspect of the selector is being changed
#### value
what value of the property applied to the selector
### animation
name it, give it a duration, then define key frames using from->to and it will go from the begining to the end in the defined duration. you can define things during the from to by using percent like at 95% do this
### media queries
changing images and things depending on the size of the browser. use @media
### float
staying in a certain place with text
#### padding
amount of room in border i think
first number is left and right, 2nd number is bottom and top
#### margin
spacing between the floating thing and text
### grid
### flex
allows elements to be flexible when the window sizes is changed. This is done on the children of the element. 100vh means it takes up 100% of the viewfinder. a 0 after flex means that element wont flex and will remain the same size. 1 means it will flex and will take up 1 of the total pieces. For example if you had 1 and 3 then 1 would take up 1 fourth and 3 would take up 3 fourths. flex direction can be row or column. section:nth-child(1) would refer to the first section from top to bottom in the given parent.
### frameworks
